                "description": "Represents telecommunications equipment or TMN entities within the telecommunications network providing support and/or service to the subscriber. An ManagedElement IOC is used to represent a Network Element defined in TS 32.101 including virtualizeation or non-virtualization scenario. An ManagedElement instance is used for communicating with a manager (directly or indirectly) over one or more management interfaces for the purpose of being monitored and/or controlled. ManagedElement may or may not additionally perform element management functionality. An ManagedElement contains equipment that may or may not be geographically distributed. A telecommunication equipment has software and hardware components. The ManagedElement IOC described above represents following two case: - In the case when the software component is designed to run on dedicated hardware component, the ManagedElement IOC description includes both software and hardware components. - In the case when the software is designed to run on ETSI NFV defined NFVI [15], the ManagedElement IOC description would exclude the NFVI component supporting the above mentioned subject software. A ManagedElement may be contained in either a SubNetwork or in a MeContext instance. A single ManagedElement may also exist stand-alone with no parent at all. The relation of ManagedElement IOC and ManagedFunction IOC can be described as following: - A ManaagedElement instance may have 1..1 containment relationship to a ManagedFunction instance. In this case, the ManagedElement IOC may be used to represent a NE with single functionality. For example, a ManagedElement is used to represent the 3GPP defined RNC node; - A ManagedElement instance may have 1..N containment relationship to multiple ManagedFunction IOC instances. In this case, the ManagedElement IOC may be used to represent a NE with combined ManagedFunction funcationality (as indicated by the managedElementType attribute and the contained instances of different ManagedFunction IOCs).For example, a ManagedElement is used to represent the combined functionality of 3GPP defined gNBCUCPFuntion, gNBCUUPFunction and gNBDUFunction",
